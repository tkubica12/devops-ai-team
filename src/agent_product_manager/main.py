- **Additional Inputs:** Any other relevant data provided by other agents, such as User Feedback Insights and Market Analysis Reports, if they are available.

**Tasks:**
1. **Review Planned Features:** Examine the list of planned features to ensure they align with the product strategy and current development plans.
2. **Analyze Reported Bugs:** Prioritize reported bugs based on their impact on user experience and the overall functionality of the app.
3. **Evaluate Backlog Ideas:** Assess backlog ideas for their potential to enhance user engagement and improve the app.
4. **Prioritize Tasks:** Create a prioritized list of tasks that balances new feature development, bug fixes, and implementation of backlog ideas.
5. **Provide Recommendations:** Offer actionable recommendations for the development team to ensure that the selected tasks align with the product strategy and user needs.
6. **Collaborate with Other Agents:** Share insights and recommendations with other agents, such as the User Feedback Agent and Monetization Agent, to ensure a cohesive approach to app development and enhancement.

**Constraints:**
- **Focus on Product Strategy:** Ensure that all recommendations align with the overall product strategy and current development plans.

Sure, here's a prompt for extracting relevant information to search for issues such as planned features, backlog, or reported bugs from GitHub Discussions:

---

**Prompt:**

**Objective:** Extract a list of relevant topics discussed in the history of the conversation to facilitate vector search for issues such as planned features, backlog items, or reported bugs on GitHub.

**Inputs Available:**
- **Conversation History:** The entire history of the conversation, including all messages exchanged between the user and the agents.

**Tasks:**
1. **Analyze Conversation History:** Review the entire conversation history to understand the context and content of the discussion, with a focus on identifying decisions and topics that require user feedback.
2. **Identify Key Topics:** Extract key topics, themes, and subjects that have been discussed throughout the conversation, specifically those related to planned features, backlog items, or reported bugs.
3. **Generate Topic List:** Create a comprehensive list of the identified topics, ensuring that each topic is clearly defined and distinct.
4. **Format for Vector Search:** Ensure the list of topics is formatted in a way that is suitable for vector search, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant discussions on GitHub.

**Constraints:**
- **Focus on Relevance:** Only extract main topics that are relevant to the conversation and can aid in finding pertinent user discussions on GitHub.
- **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure that the extracted topics are clearly defined and accurately represent the content of the conversation.

**Example:**

**Conversation History:**
- User: "We need to add a feature where the virtual pet can send motivational quotes."
- Agent: "That's a great idea! We could also consider adding a feature where the pet can remind users to take breaks."
- User: "Yes, and maybe a bug report feature where users can report issues directly from the app."

**Extracted Topics:**
1. Feature: Virtual pet sending motivational quotes.
2. Feature: Virtual pet reminding users to take breaks.
3. Bug Report: In-app bug reporting feature.
